A Simple password manager. Project Exercise work for COMP.SEC.300 Secure Programming. Mostly done as a demonstration of synchronizing the database to a tor hidden service server.

The program has some limitations and I don't recommend actually using it for storing your passwords.

The server can be hosted anywhere, as hidden services don't need a static IP address.
